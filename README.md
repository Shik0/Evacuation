Stuff Evacuation Application
============================

When alarms happen in any company it is important to rescue all stuff to the secure place (sometimes we call that place Master Point or Assembly Point). As a standard procedure, HSE members have to check all stuff in the master point to be sure that all stuff rescued and no one remain in the alarm zone.

But manually checking all stuff is a time consuming process and there are high possibilities that we can miss (or skip unintentionally) someone from the check list.

Using this application company's HSE department can fully automate Master Point checking process and save precious time to find other employees (stuff members) in the alarm zone.

Process workflow:

1. Application collects information from company stuff database (it is an individual configuration)
2. All stuff have to check in the entrance tourniquet(wicket) with their own badge
3. Application makes synchronization with tourniquet database and update all information about stuff arrivals and leaves
4. When alarm happens stuff make check in the Master Point and set stuff member status in "Master Point"

HSE members can follow all this processes online using web interface.

**Please, check requirements before using the application**
